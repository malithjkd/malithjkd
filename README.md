Vision-based approaches are widely used in research to classify objects. However, there are specifications of objects that are difficult to distinguish using only vision-based sensors, such as vegetables that look good on the outside but are rotten on the inside, ripe or unripe fruits, and objects made to mimic real objects.

The feel of the objects may reveal the distinguishing characteristics of the object or the state of the object, which may help to classify them. Haptic-based object classification has gained popularity in recent years. However, the majority of object classification studies only use sensory information for classification. The goal of my research is to construct a few additional features for object classification and identify the best feature set.
